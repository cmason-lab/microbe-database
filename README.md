## Microbe.Directory v0.1

# Curation

This contains the final Excel spreadsheet that contains all of the summer students' work. It also contains the scripts that I used to clean the data, as well as the scripts to go from xlsx --> sqlite. This also contains the API's I've used to access the data from sqlite3 and put it into python. It will also contain scripts for exporting the database to alternative formats (e.g. json, csv, etc.).

# JPM StuckOnU

This contains all of the code I used for the JPM event StuckOnU.

# Submissions Automation

This contains all of the code I used to send out assignments to the summer students each week (and presearch them), compile their responses, and add their weekly contributinos to the master xlsx. This directory is a bit messy...
