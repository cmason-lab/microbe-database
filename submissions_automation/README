----- CREATING ASSIGNMENTS TO EMAIL OUT -----

*** This should only be done once at the beginning of the project

1) Run assess_master.py
2) Delete everything in 'assignments/unassigned/' then run create_assignments.py
	- modify constants such as num_submitters and submissions_pwer_week
3) Run presearch_assignments.py  to create helper HTML files for each assignment

assess_master.py
	- goes through annotations_master.xlsx and sees which organisms have no columns filled
		- populate annotations_to_assign.xlsx with the blank organisms

create_assignments.py
	- populates 'assignments/unassigned/' by splitting assess_master.py's resulting spreadsheet
	
presearch_assignments.py
	- presearches predefined databases to see if entries exist for the Genus species
	- saves HTML file with the above results, named as ID number_week number_presearch.html
		- open this file in web browser to assist with annotations

annotations_automator.py
	- actually carries out the presearch in presearch_assignments.py
	
----- EMAIL WORKFLOW -----

*** Only run initial_assignments_email.py once at the beginning of the project!!!
1) initial_assignments_email.py gives everyone an assignment and starts the workflow
2) process_emails.py (akcnowledges submissions) runs every hour via CRON
3) process_submissions.py (actually updates master) runs at 12:00 pm on Mondays via CRON

submitters.xlsx
	- the first sheet contains ID number, name, and contact info for each volunteer
	- each volunteer also gets a sheet named by his or her ID number--this will contain a log on what
	he/she has been assigned

process_emails.py
	- checks for new emails and downloads them to 'submissions'
		- changes email label from 'unprocessed' to 'processed'
	- updates submitters.xlsx and acknowledges the submission
	- sends out new assignment
		- attaches template from '/assignments/ID number/ID number_week number.xlsx'
		- attaches helper HTML file from '/assignments/ID number/ID number_week number.html'
	- runs every hour via CRON

process_submissions.py
	- processes each excel file in 'submissions/unprocessed/' and updates the master spreadsheet
		- moves the excel file from '/unprocessed/' to '/processed/'
	- runs at 12:00 pm on Mondays via CRON
	- runs backup.py

backup.sh
	- create backup on file system (in backups/) of submitters.xlsx and annotations_master.xlsx
	- upload master spreadsheet to dropbox once a week
		- may or may not implement
	- run by CRON once a day

----- RANDOM STUFF -----

annotations_master.xlsx
	- the current, live copy of the database

submitters.xlsx
	- contains contact info for each submitter from Fall 2016/Spring 2017
	- logs each assignment/submission by submitter ID in a separate sheet
	
config.py
	- constants

error.log
	- errors from any of the above scripts are handled here
	
compile_summer_submissions.py
	- processes each excel file from the summer of 2016 'submissions/unprocessed/'
		- adds each summer intern's submissions to annotations_master.xlsx
	- this req's a different python file bc these are formatted differently
	- only run once at the beginning of the project
